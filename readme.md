This project is an exploratory analysis of Magazine Luiza's stock in 2021. Magazine Luiza is a Brazilian retail company.

The plots show that between January and March there was a small drop in the share price, but what is most striking is after July. From July onwards, the stock price plummeted from the R$23 range to the R$7 range.

There are several factors behind this drop. This is just an exploratory analysis that is not intended to recommend investments, only to draw the conclusions that in the middle of 2021 there was a stock drop in Magazine Luiza's stock price. 

Economic fundamentals may explain why the stocks price fell by more than 50%. In addition, it was a year affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which certainly helped the fall in value of the stocks of a giant in the Brazilian retail sector.
